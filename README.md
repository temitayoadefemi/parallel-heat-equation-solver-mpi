# parallel-heat-equation-solver-mpi(amr)
 This repository contains a parallel implementation of a heat equation solver using the finite difference method with adaptive mesh refinement. The parallelization is achieved using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library, which allows the program to run on distributed-memory systems, such as clusters or supercomputers.
